# Unix Utilities

In this project, you'll build a few different UNIX utilities, simple versions
of commonly used commands like **cat**, **ls**, etc. We'll call each of them a
slightly different name to avoid confusion; for example, instead of **cat**,
you'll be implementing **my-cat**.

Objectives:
* Re-familiarize yourself with the C programming language
* Learn a little about how UNIX utilities are implemented
* Learn (as a side effect) how to use a proper code editor such as emacs

## my-cat

The program **my-cat** is a simple program. Generally, it reads a file as
specified by the user and prints its contents. A typical usage is as follows: 

```
my-cat main.c
```

In this case, **my-cat** will read the file **main.c** and print out its
contents. 

You'll need to learn how to use a few library routines from the C library to
implement the source code for this program, which we'll assume is in a file
called **my-cat.c**.
